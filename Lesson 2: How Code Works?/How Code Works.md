# Lesson 2: How Code Works?

# How code executes

Chips speaks 1s and 0s (Binary code)

# **Different Execution Models**

## Interpreted code

**Interpreter** is one program running another program

It basically takes the english readable files and then converts it into readable binary code that can be understood by the chip or the processor

## Complied Code

> ðŸ’¡ **Compiler converts the source code file into an executable file that can run instructions much faster than an interpreter would do.**

## Just-In-Time Code

Binary file can run on any platform.

The source code file, the intermediate compiler and the intermediate file will be all on the developerâ€™s system 

Then this intermediate file will be sent on the CI/CD for example, compile it specific to CPU/system/platform and then execute it.

### Broad Types of programming languages

- **Procedural** â†’ Sequential, Linear in execution- example: COBOL (Do A and then Do B and so onâ€¦.)
- **Functional** â†’ Scientific - processes large sets of data in a very accurate fashion â†’ F#
- **Object Oriented** â†’ Ruby, Java, C# â†’ Approach problem solving by creating objects to represent things that you are working with.

## Files

## **Classes**

> ðŸ’¡ **Class is a thing/noun that represents something about the system you are writing.***

Base Class can have properties and behaviours which a sub class can inherit.

A sub class can it have it own properties and behaviour apart from the properties and behaviours that is inherited from the base class.

In the above example. The base class is animal which has the properties of weight, size and color and behaviours of move, breath.

A subclass which is a bird and dog has its own unique properties and behaviours like Bird can fly and a Dog can bark apart from the main behaviour which is to move and breathe. Apart from that the properties is unique for these sub classes as well which includes for example for a Bird it has a wingspan and for a Dog it is fur type which is unique to this subclass.

### Summary

- CPU types are unique
- Different execution models get text to CPU
- Files vs. Classes Vs. Objects
- Classes are THINGS
- Types and variables hold info
- Methods are behaviours
