# Coding For Non-Coders
Learn how to get started with code using .NET


- These are a few of my learning notes from the course by the instructor Jim Holmes from the Ministry of Testing.

- This course is designed to help non-developers become comfortable with reading and writing basic code. The aim isn't to teach you how to build highly complex systems but to familiarize you with how software moves from code to executable programs. It focuses on making the learning experience approachable and enjoyable, even for beginners.

### Key Takeaways:
- Build Understanding: The course teaches how to identify well-written software by building your own application in small, manageable steps using a test-first approach.
- Long-term Code Health: You'll learn factors that affect the long-term quality and health of the code your team is working on.
- Coding is Fun: Beyond productivity, the course emphasizes that coding can be an enjoyable process.
